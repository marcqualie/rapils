# Rapils

**NOTE:** Not for production use. This is my own experimental framework I use for small prototype projects. Use at your own risk.

Opinionated out-of-the-box Rails API framework.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rapils'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

### Models

In order to use the models, you need to extend the base models inside your application:

```ruby
class User < Rapils::Models::User
end
```
